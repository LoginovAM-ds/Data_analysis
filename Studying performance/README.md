## R-square
The square of the model is 0.242, which means that the model explains approximately 24.2% of the variance in the total student score.This means that there are other variables that explain the model better.
## Education of parents
 The level of education of parents has a significant impact on the overall score of students. For example, the level of education "master's degree" is positively related to the overall score, while "high school" has a negative impact.
 ## Gender
Gender also affects the overall score. Men have a lower expected average overall score compared to women.
## Race/Ethnicity
Data shows that different groups of races/ethnicity may have differences in overall scores. For example, Group E has the highest average scores.
## Lunch
The variable "lunch" has no statistically significant effect on the overall score of students (P-value > 0.05). This means that the type of lunch (free/reduced or standard) does not have a statistically significant impact on student performance, taking into account other variables in the model.
## Test Preparation Course 
The variable "test preparation course" also has no statistically significant effect on the overall score of students (P-value > 0.05). This means that the fact of taking a preparatory course before the exam or its absence does not have a statistically significant impact on student performance, taking into account other variables in the model.
